# modular_c_example

This is my attempt at transcribing what I found [in this magazine article](https://www.embedded.com/modular-programming-in-c/) into something I can refer back to more easily.

This is all untested. Its only purpose is to serve as an example of this technique that I can refer back to when developing medium-sized embedded C applications.
